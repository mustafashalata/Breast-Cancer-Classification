# Breast-Cancer-Classification

Breast cancer is a disease in which cells in the breast grow out of control in  a rapidly.  Breast cancer  occurs when a malignant (cancerous) tumor originates in the breast cells. It is the most commonly occurring cancer in women and the second most common cancer overall. Around 2 million cases were observed in 2018.  The  early  diagnosis  of  breast  cancer  can  improve  the prognosis and chance of survival significantly, as it can promote timely clinical treatment  to patients affected.  Further accurate classification from the data of benign tumors can prevent patients from  undergoing  unnecessary  treatments.  Thus,  the  correct diagnosis of breast cancer and the classification of patients into malignant or benign groups is the subject of all research done and observed. Because  of its  unique advantages  in critical  features detection from complex breast cancer datasets, machine learning (ML) is widely recognized as the methodology of choice in Breast Cancer pattern classification. This project is a relative study of the implementation of  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)(resnet 50) which is done on beakhis dataset taken from kaggle .

dataset :  Breast Cancer Histopathological Image Classification (BreakHis) is composed of 9,109 microscopic images of breast tumor tissue collected from 82 patients using different magnifying factors (40X, 100X, 200X, and 400X). To date, it contains 2,480 benign and 5,429 malignant samples (700X460 pixels, 3-channel RGB, 8-bit depth in each channel, PNG format). This database has been built in collaboration with the P&D Laboratory â€“ Pathological Anatomy and Cytopathology, Parana, Brazil
